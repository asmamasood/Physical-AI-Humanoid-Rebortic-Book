# Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence that interacts with the physical world through sensors and actuators. Unlike purely digital AI, which processes information in a virtual environment, Physical AI must deal with the complexity, uncertainty, and physical constraints of the real world.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Embodiment**: The idea that intelligence requires a physical body to interact with the world.
2.  **Sensors**: Devices that allow the AI to perceive its environment (e.g., cameras, LIDAR, tactile sensors).
3.  **Actuators**: Mechanisms that allow the AI to move and manipulate objects (e.g., motors, hydraulics).
4.  **Control Systems**: The algorithms that govern how the AI moves and reacts.

## Humanoid Robots

Humanoid robots are a specific type of Physical AI designed to resemble the human form. This design choice is often driven by the desire to have robots operate in environments built for humans (e.g., homes, offices) and to facilitate natural human-robot interaction.

Challenges in humanoid robotics include:
*   **Balance and Locomotion**: Walking on two legs is inherently unstable and requires complex control.
*   **Dexterous Manipulation**: Human hands are incredibly versatile; replicating this capability is difficult.
*   **Power Efficiency**: Mobile robots have limited energy storage.
