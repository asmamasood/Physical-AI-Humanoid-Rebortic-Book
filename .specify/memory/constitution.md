# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Content Integrity
All content must be accurate, original, and completely free of plagiarism. Originality will be verified through automated checks.

### II. Rigorous Sourcing & Citation
All factual claims and referenced concepts must be supported by APA-style citations. The project will include a minimum of 15 distinct sources, with at least 50% sourced from peer-reviewed academic journals, conference proceedings, or equivalent scholarly publications.

### III. Accessible Academic Style
The writing style must be clear, formal, and academic, tailored for a Grade 10–12 reading comprehension level. Each lesson must include an introduction, detailed explanations with real-world examples, a summary, at least one explanatory diagram, a set of exercises, and a glossary of key terms.

### IV. Bilingual Delivery (English & Urdu)
The entire book, including all content, navigation, and UI elements, must be fully implemented and functional in both English and Urdu. A seamless language toggle must be present on every page.

### V. Production-Grade Docusaurus Implementation
The final output must be a valid Docusaurus v3 project. The site must build without any errors, feature automatically generated sidebars, and include a pre-configured GitHub Actions workflow for successful deployment to GitHub Pages.

### VI. Modular Structure
The book is organized into 4 modules, each containing 2-3 chapters or sub-chapters, for a total of 4,000-5,000 words.

## Governance
This Constitution is the single source of truth for project principles and governance. It supersedes all other practices and documentation. All development, reviews, and contributions must verify compliance with this constitution. Amendments require a documented proposal, formal approval from project maintainers, and a clear migration plan for any affected components.
