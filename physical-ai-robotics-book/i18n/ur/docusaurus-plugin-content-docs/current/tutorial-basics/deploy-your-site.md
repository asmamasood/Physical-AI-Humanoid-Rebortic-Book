# Deploy your site (Urdu - Placeholder)

Docusaurus is a **static-site-generator** (also called **[Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/)**). (Urdu - Placeholder)

It builds your site as simple **static HTML, JavaScript and CSS files**. (Urdu - Placeholder)

## Build your site (Urdu - Placeholder)

Build your site **for production**: (Urdu - Placeholder)

```bash
npm run build
```

The static files are generated in the `build` folder. (Urdu - Placeholder)

## Deploy your site (Urdu - Placeholder)

Test your production build locally: (Urdu - Placeholder)

```bash
npm run serve
```

The `build` folder is now served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). (Urdu - Placeholder)

You can now deploy the `build` folder **almost anywhere** easily, **for free** or very small cost (read the **[Deployment Guide](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment)**). (Urdu - Placeholder)
