# Tutorial Intro (Urdu - Placeholder)

Let's discover **Docusaurus in less than 5 minutes**. (Urdu - Placeholder)

## Getting Started (Urdu - Placeholder)

Get started by **creating a new site**. (Urdu - Placeholder)

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**. (Urdu - Placeholder)

### What you'll need (Urdu - Placeholder)

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 20.0 or above: (Urdu - Placeholder)
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies. (Urdu - Placeholder)

## Generate a new site (Urdu - Placeholder)

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**. (Urdu - Placeholder)

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command: (Urdu - Placeholder)

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor. (Urdu - Placeholder)

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus. (Urdu - Placeholder)

## Start your site (Urdu - Placeholder)

Run the development server: (Urdu - Placeholder)

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there. (Urdu - Placeholder)

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/. (Urdu - Placeholder)

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes. (Urdu - Placeholder)
