## The Era of Embodied Intelligence

For decades, Artificial Intelligence lived primarily in servers—processing text, images, and data without ever touching the real world. That era is ending. 

**Physical AI** refers to intelligent systems that have a physical body and must interact with the laws of physics. It's not just about "brains" anymore; it's about the complex feedback loop between sensing, thinking, and acting.

### Why This Matters

1.  **Safety Critical**: Unlike a chatbot that can hallucinate an answer, a robot that "hallucinates" a movement can fall or cause damage.
2.  **Real-Time Constraints**: Physical AI must operate in hard real-time. A 500ms delay in processing can mean the difference between stable walking and falling over.
3.  **Sim-to-Real Gap**: Training in simulation is fast, but transferring those policies to the noisy, imperfect real world is one of the hardest challenges in modern robotics.

In this book (and this blog), we will dive deep into these challenges. We'll cover everything from **ROS 2** nodes and **Control Theory** to **Reinforcement Learning** for locomotion.

Stay tuned for technical deep dives, tutorials, and updates!
-   **Updates**: New features in the textbook and chatbot.

The chatbot (available on the book pages) is your study partner. It can summarize chapters, answer technical questions, and even quiz you on the material.

Happy Reading!
